== RISC-V atomics mappings

This specifies mappings of C and {Cpp} atomic operations to RISC-V
machine instructions. Other languages, for example Java, provide similar
facilities that should be implemented in a consistent manner, usually
by applying the mapping for the corresponding {Cpp} primitive.

NOTE: Because different programming languages may be used within the same
process, these mappings must be compatible across programming languages. For
example, Java programmers expect memory ordering guarantees to be enforced even
if some of the actual memory accesses are performed by a library written in
C.

NOTE: Though many mappings are possible, not all of them will interoperate
correctly. In particular, many mapping combinations will not
correctly enforce orderingÂ  between a {Cpp} `memory_order_seq_cst`
store and a subsequent `memory_order_seq_cst` load.

NOTE: These mappings are very similar to those that originally appeared in the
appendix of the RISC-V "unprivileged" architecture specification as
"Mappings from C/{Cpp} primitives to RISC-V Primitives", which we will
refer to by their 2019 historical label of "Table A.6". That mapping may
be used, _except_ that `atomic_store(memory_order_seq_cst)` must have an
an extra trailing fence for compatibility with the "Hypothetical mappings ..."
table in the same section, which we similarly refer to as "Table A.7".
As a result, we allow the "Table A.7" mappings as well.

NOTE: Our primary design goal is to maximize performance of the "Table A.7"
mappings. These require additional load-acquire and store-release instructions,
and are this not immediately usable. By requiring the extra store fence.
or equivalent, we avoid an ABI break when moving to the "Table A.7"
mappings in the future, in return for a small performance penalty in the
short term.

For each construct, we provide a mapping that assumes only the A extension.
In some cases, we provide additional mappings that assume a future load-acquire
and store-release extension, as denoted by note 1 in the table.

All mappings interoperate correctly, and with the original "Table A.6"
mappings, _except_ that mappings marked with note 3 do not interoperate
with the original "Table A.6" mappings.

We present the mappings as a table in 3 sections. The first
deals with translations for loads, stores, and fences. The next two sections
address mappings for read-modify-write operations like `fetch_add`, and
`exchange`. The second section deals with operations that have direct
`amo` instruction equivalents in the RISC-V A extension. The final
section deals with other read-modify-write operations that require
the `lr` and `sc` instructions.

=== Meaning of notes in table

1) Depends on a load instruction with an RCsc acquire annotation,
or a store instruction with an RCsc release annotation. These are currently
under discussion, but the specification has not yet been approved.

2) An RCpc load or store would also suffice, if it were to be introduced
in the future.

3) Incompatible with the original "Table A.6" mapping. Do not combine these
mappings with code generated by a compiler using those older mappings.
(This was mostly used by the initial LLVM implementations for RISC-V.)

4) Currently only directly possible for 32- and 64-bit operands.

5) atomic_compare_exchange operations with a memory_order_seq_cst failure
ordering are considered to have a note 3 annotation.
To remove the note 3 annotation the amocas operation must be prepended with a
leading fence (`fence rw,rw; amocas.{w\|d}.aqrl`).

== Ztso atomics mappings

This specifies additional mappings of C and {Cpp} atomic operations to RISC-V
machine instructions.

For each construct, we provide a mapping that assumes only the A and Ztso
extension.

All mappings interoperate correctly with the RVWMO mappings, and with the
original "Table A.6" mappings, _except_ that mappings marked with note 3 do not
interoperate with the original "Table A.6" mappings.

We present the mappings as a table in 3 sections, as above.

== Other conventions

It is expected that the RVWMO and Ztso AMO Mappings will be used for atomic
read-modify-write operations that are directly supported by corresponding AMO
instructions, and that LR/SC mappings will be used for the remainder, currently
including compare-exchange operations. Compare-exchange LR/SC sequences
on the containing 32-bit word should be used for shorter operands. Thus,
a `fetch_add` operation on a 16-bit quantity would use a 32-bit LR/SC sequence.

It is acceptable, but usually undesirable for performance reasons, to use LR/SC
mappings where an AMO mapping would suffice.

Atomics do not imply any ordering for IO operations. IO operations
should include sufficient fences to prevent them from being visibly
reordered with atomic operations.

Float and double atomic loads and stores should be implemented using
the integer sequences.

Float and double read-modify-write instructions should consist of a loop performing
an initial plain load of the value, followed by the floating point
computation, followed by an integer compare-and-swap sequence to try to
store back the updated value. This avoids floating point
instructions between LR and SC instructions. Depending on language requirements,
it may be necessary to save and restore floating-point exception flags in the
case of an operation that is later redone due to a failed SC operation.

NOTE: The "Eventual Success of Store-Conditional Instructions" section
in the ISA specification provides that essential progress guarantee only
if there are no floating point instructions between the LR and matching SC
instruction. By compiling such sequences with an "extra" ordinary load,
and performing the floating point computation before the LR, we preserve
the guarantee.
